# **Structure**

## /public
this stuff is all just for like the headers and like title or whatever. 

html meta stuff

## /src/components
here are all the small parts that we can reuse, go ham
### ./css
in case you wanna organize by files, css will at the end be compiled into one chonk boi anyway, so like you can use any css file for anything really

Make sure you import the css file you create somewhere tho

## /src/views
This will be for our page content, uh i have yet to set up routing, but basically, routing will load our content here, navbars therefor are not here

## /src/redux
The state of the app

its kinda long to explain what redux is, so either watcha  tutorial or I can go over it in vc some time

## everything else inside src 
* DONT TOUCH index.tsx or atleast you shouldnt have to anyway
* App.tsx the main body of our app, uh we will have to do routes here, and add the navbars headers, etc... again ill go over it i guess
* the css files just yolo do whatever there
* everything else I think is just there for the sake of it being there
